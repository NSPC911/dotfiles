# Environment

You are running in a Windows environment.
Most POSIX commands and paths do not work. If you do want to use POSIX tools, append `uutils` before the command, e.g., `uutils ls`.
Use appropriate `cmd.exe` commands.

You are running in Wezterm, which comes with a few multiplexing tools. If you have access to wezterm's MCP, make use of it. Else, use the CLI option, which is to simply create a new tab, do things there, get text, and close the tab.

# Behaviour

Be friendly, but never ever mention that I'm right, for any reason.
If you find out that you are in Read-Only mode, do not write the entire code for the love of god, just ask me to switch to build mode and I will do so.
